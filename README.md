# Automated Code Review Assistant

## Problem Statement

Design a CI/CD pipeline. Use ML to identify performance bottlenecks. Use GenAI to provide review comments and optimized code.

## Mandatory Coverage

- **Cloud**: Lambda, CodeBuild, CodePipeline
- **Data**: S3, Glue
- **GenAI**: Technical reviewer bot

## Advanced Features

- **Technical Debt Visualizer**: Build a Technical Debt Visualizer using GenAI that analyzes the last 100 commits (Data) and generates a report on which modules need "Refactoring" most urgently.
